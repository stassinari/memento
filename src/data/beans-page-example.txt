Brewing Advice:

- Water: Use mineral water with a soft Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) count, ideally below 150 ppm.

Hacienda La Papaya:

Hacienda La Papaya is located just outside the town of Saraguro, in the Loja region of Southern Ecuador. The Hacienda has been in Juan’s family since the end of colonial rule and holds great importance for the whole family, having spent their summers there since childhood. Juan began experimenting with coffee here in 2010 and transitioned to working in coffee full-time in 2014 after his rose crop was wiped out by a violent storm in Cuenca.

Over the years, he has dedicated himself to the pursuit of high-quality coffee with a meticulous and scientific approach. This dedication, shaped by Juan’s experience in roses and his training as an agricultural engineer, has led to a significant rise in quality and international recognition over just 8 years. His obsessive experimentation and need for scientific evidence are cornerstones of his work at each stage—from carefully applied and monitored fertilization, constant measurement of brix and cherry weight during harvest, innovation in fermentation, to the exacting drying process.
